# Price Pilot

A Vite + React cockpit for managing Shopify pricing strategies across bracelets, necklaces, rings, hand chains, and sets. The tool keeps prices and compare-at prices synchronized, supports preview and backup flows, and respects Azor Jewelry’s luxury rounding rules.

## Features

- 🔐 **Environment-driven login** – Username and password read from environment variables.
- 🧮 **Global percentage adjustments** – Apply rounded increases/decreases with compare-at mirroring.
- 💎 **Collection playbooks** – Dedicated pages for bracelets, necklaces, rings, hand chains, and sets.
- 🧾 **Live previews & activity log** – Inspect price/compare-at changes before applying and review actions in chronological logs.
- 💾 **Backups and restore** – One-click snapshot and rollback per workflow.
- 🌐 **English/French toggle** – Switch instantly between languages.
- 🎨 **Tailwind styling** – Responsive UI using the provided Azor Jewelry palette.

> **Note:** The codebase is intentionally JavaScript-only. No `.ts`, `.tsx`, or declaration files are used so the project aligns with the requested stack.

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   > If registry access is restricted, configure your npm proxy or install packages in an environment with public npm access.

2. **Configure credentials**

   Copy the example environment file and adjust the values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   | Variable | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | `VITE_APP_USERNAME` | Username required to sign in |
   | `VITE_APP_PASSWORD` | Password required to sign in |
   | `VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` | Your Shopify storefront domain (e.g. `azorjewelry.myshopify.com`) |
   | `VITE_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Admin API access token used for authenticated requests |
   | `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Secret used to verify webhook signatures from Shopify |

   The Shopify values are available in the app through `import.meta.env.VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` and `import.meta.env.VITE_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` whenever you wire the API calls.

3. **Generate a Shopify Admin API token**

   Shopify issues Admin API tokens from a custom app inside your store. You only need to do this once per store:

   1. Sign in to your Shopify admin and open **Settings ▸ Apps and sales channels**.
   2. Click **Develop apps** (enable it if prompted) and select **Create an app**.
   3. Give the app a name such as “Price Pilot” and create it.
   4. Under **Configuration**, add the following Admin API scopes:
      - `read_products`
      - `write_products`
      - `read_product_listings`
      - `write_product_listings`
   5. Save, then go to **API credentials**, click **Install app**, and confirm.
   6. Copy the **Admin API access token** (it is shown only once) and place it in your `.env` file as `VITE_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
   7. Copy your store domain (e.g. `azorjewelry.myshopify.com`) into `VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`.

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Vite will print a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Why you still see only eight products

The React app cannot call Shopify’s Admin REST API directly from the browser. The
`fetchActiveProducts` helper in `src/services/shopify.js` issues requests such as
`https://<store>/admin/api/<version>/products.json`, but Shopify blocks those
calls from client-side JavaScript via CORS unless they go through an authenticated
backend under your control. When the request is rejected, the pricing store falls
back to the bundled mock catalog, which contains the original eight placeholder
products, so every preview still shows only that limited list.

To load your real catalog you must proxy the Admin API through a secure server.
You can reuse the existing Express webhook server in `shopify/webhookServer.js`
or create a new endpoint that:

1. Runs on your infrastructure (or as a serverless function).
2. Reads the Admin API token from server-side environment variables.
3. Calls the `/admin/api/<version>/products.json` endpoint with pagination.
4. Returns the normalized product data to the React app.

Do **not** expose the Admin API token in the browser—Shopify treats it as a
secret. Once the frontend points to your proxy endpoint, the pricing dashboard
will receive every active product instead of the mock eight-item list.

## Key concepts

- **Luxury rounding** – All computed prices are rounded to the closest value ending in `00` or `90`.
- **Supplement editors** – Modify the supplements for each variant type; hand chain values derive automatically from necklace data, and sets combine bracelet + necklace supplements.
- **Compare-at parity** – Every price update mirrors immediately to its compare-at counterpart.
- **Backups** – Trigger a backup before applying to preserve the current state. Restore at any time from the activity log panel.

## Automating Forsat S changes from Shopify

Whenever you update the **Forsat S** base price directly inside Shopify, you can forward the event to this project so that every other variant is recalculated automatically.

1. **Expose the webhook listener**

   ```bash
   npm run webhook
   ```

   The server listens on port `3000` by default. Use a tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose `http://localhost:3000/webhooks/product-update` to Shopify.

2. **Capture the webhook secret** – In your Shopify custom app, open **Configuration ▸ Webhooks** and copy the signing secret. Place it in `.env` as `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

3. **Create the webhook** – Still inside the custom app, add a **Product update** webhook and point it to the public URL from step 1. Select the same Admin API version configured in the server (defaults to `2024-04`).

4. **Trigger updates** – Whenever a product tagged `brac`, `nckl`, or `set` (and marked active) has its Forsat S variant price changed, the webhook listener:
   - locates the Forsat S + 41cm base variant,
   - recalculates every other variant using the supplement tables in `src/data/supplements.js`,
   - rounds prices to the nearest `00`/`90`,
   - mirrors the values onto `compare_at_price`, and
   - calls Shopify’s Admin API to persist the new numbers.

5. **Monitor the logs** – The listener prints a summary for each product. You can also `GET /healthz` to verify the service is alive.

> **Tip:** Adjusting supplements inside the React dashboard updates the preview state only. To keep webhook automation in sync, edit `src/data/supplements.js` (and restart the webhook server) so both paths share the same supplement values.
